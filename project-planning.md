# Project Planning

Please throw all ideas in this document, we'll make it neat later - Michael 17/07/2024

## Problem Definition: As of now, achievable and hands-free solutions for wasp relocation are not commonplace

Currently, PCB manual assembly is:

- Time-consuming
- Error-prone/Inaccurate
- Expensive (Labour costs)
- Constant monitoring
- Non-scalable
- Manager has to work with people :(

## Constraints

### Hard Constraints

- Scalable (Mass Production)
- Cost (Maximum)
- Dimensions - We are designing for PCBs with a square width of 300mm*300mm or smaller will be used.
- Simple Design, should be easy to repair
- Does it pick, does it place?
- Must be feasible to finish before week 6
  
### Soft Constraints

- Cost
- Scalable
- Easy to use (What training is needed?)
- Manufacturing Complexity
- Primarily use given materials
- Simple Design
- Should minimise required user input

## What we want to achieve

- Automation of placing components
- Replaces by-hand component placement, which is difficult and slow.
- Reduces component placement time
